# Code Mixing in NLP and Speech

This seminar is closed. A short summary of the papers that were covered can be found [here](https://tech.skit.ai/Code-Mixing-Seminar/). There were some interesting metrics that we came across which have been documented [here](https://tech.skit.ai/Code-Mixing-Metrics/).

**Members** - Jaivarsan, Kriti, Shahid, Swaraj, Shashank, Shangeth

**Goal** : Learn the different approaches taken to work with code-mixed data in speech and language tech. Here code-mixing is used in an expansive sense and includes code-switching as well.
